# How-to-buy-a-kindle-ebook-on-Amazon-in-China
There are certain restrictions when purchasing Kindle books on Amazon while you’re in China, even if you’re using a VPN with an American proxy. To bypass these restrictions, you can generate a U.S. address through https://addressgenerator.top/zh/us-address-generator and update your Amazon account with that information. 
Additionally, you can generate a U.S. phone number on the same site, or obtain one from https://zh.receive-sms.cc/US-Phone-Number/, which allows you to receive messages.
